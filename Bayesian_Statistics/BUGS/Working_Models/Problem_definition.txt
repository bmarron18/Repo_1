	Problem statement
#####################################



######################################
	Problem Structure:
	Assumptions as limits of the investigation
	Assumptions as definition of the system under investigation
#######################################
 
define assumptions:
	--the scale of investigation and causation (environment, system, subsystem)
	--the fluxes between environment and system; between system and subsystem
	--the causal and logical links
	--the process(es) under investigation
	--the fundamental entities (populations) involved
	--the observable (and measurable) attributes or outcomes of interest
	--the 
coupled to the attributes or outcomes of interest, and the primary statisitcs



==== the scale of investigation and causation (systems perspective) ========================================

environmental_sphere2:		--British healthcare system

environmental_sphere1: 		--network of all British hospitals

system:				--heart transplant unit	in a generic British hospital

subsystem(s):			--heart transplant recipients
				--heart transplant donors
				--physicians
				--nursing staff
				--infrastructure and equipment


==== the fluxes (matter, energy, information)/time  ===========================================================
fluxes
(env_spheres <---> system):	--none; system assumed isolated; snapshot analysis
				--heart transplant unit assumed static w/ respect to the hospital

fluxes
(system <---> subsystem):	--physicians, nursing staff, infrastructure, equipment, practices (ie, info transfer) assumed static
				w/in the heart transplant unit over the time of the analysis
				--assumed pulsed flux of recipients (cases) from a well-defined (known) population that is
				homogeneous w/ respect to many of the characteristics affecting success of heart transplant surgery;
				the variability in the initial conditions of the cases is fixed and stationary; cases are representative 
				of the population (but a pulsed flux is NOT a random sample!)      
				--assumed pulsed flux of donors from a well-defined (known) population that is
				homogeneous w/ respect to many of the characteristics affecting success of heart transplant surgery;
				the variability in the initial conditions of the donors is fixed and stationary; donors are representative 
				of the population (but a pulsed flux is NOT a random sample!)

	The data sets

==== investigated_process1: heart transplant surgery survival and life expectancy ===========================


fundamental entities of interest (pop.s);
observable (measurable) attributes;
generating distributions;
empirical data sets

			--cases w/ heart disease who do not undergo heart transplant surgery
			--life expectancy (years)
			--Y.99 ~ dexp (0.5)
			--no data

			--cases w/ heart disease who do undergo the surgery
			--surgery survival (binary) 
			--Y.98a ~ dbern (0.8)
			--no data

			--cases w/ heart disease who do undergo the surgery
			--life expectancy (years)
			--Y.98b ~ dexp (0.2)
			--no data

	Problem Structure:
	Logical translation
#######################################

==== the (in)dependencies in the relations of assumed causal and logical propositional links ==========================


propositional_link1:	survival(s) <==> heart transplant surgery (hts) 
				--causal; logically dependent
				-- m dependent on hts
				--P(s) = âˆ«d(hts) P(s|hts)P(hts)


propositional_link2:	longevity (L) <==> survival(s) <==> heart transplant surgery (hts)
				--causal; logically dependent
				--longevity is dependent on heart transplant surgery thru surgery survival
				--P(L AND s)) = P(L|s) P(s)
